# Personal scripts repository
## Idea
Just keeping my scripts versioned in a place, that might help someone. I usually keep them in `${HOME}/.scripts` so change that in [SOURCE_ME.sh](SOURCE_ME.sh)
## Usage
Source the SOURCE_ME.sh script in your profile, maybe change the path in it. Example: 
```bash
[ -f "${HOME}/.scripts/SOURCE_ME.sh" ] && source "${HOME}/.scripts/SOURCE_ME.sh"
```
